# FinBERT-fine-tuned
This is a fine-tuned FinBERT model by sentiment focus, the data used FOMC minutes 2006.1 to 2023.2.
## Why Fine-tune FinBERT
The drawbacks of FinBERT is obvious. FinBERT has great performance in simple financial sentences, when it turns to complex sentences which contains disjunctive words( Although, While, But), FinBERT would easily misclassify the sentiment. The orientation for fine-tining is to make FinBERT more fit complex financial sentences.
